# MODFLOW 6 and FloPy: Take Your Modeling Skills to the Next Level
Training materials for the MODFLOW 6 and FloPy workshop offered at the 2024 Modflow and More Conference at Princeton University

## Location
Princeton Univeristy, building and class room to be determined
May 31 - June 1, 2024


## Course Description
MODFLOW 6 is the current version of MODFLOW released and supported by the USGS.  The program is under active development by the short course instructors and the broader hydrologic community.  This short course introduces participants to MODFLOW 6 and its growing simulation capabilities.  For each topic included in the short course, there will be a short lecture on the underlying concepts and implementation followed by a live demonstration.  Live demonstrations will use the Python language, Jupyter Notebooks, and the FloPy Package to create, run, and post-process MODFLOW 6 simulations. 

The following topics will be covered during the short course.
*	Getting started with MODFLOW 6 and FloPy
*	XT3D multi-point flux approximation for modeling aquifers with full three-dimensional anisotropy
*	Structured and unstructured discretization strategies (quadtree, triangular, and voronoi meshes, and local grid refinement)
*	Advanced packages (Multi-Aquifer Well, Streamflow Routing, Lake, Unsaturated Zone Flow, Water Mover, and Compaction and SUBsidence)
*	Constant and variable-density flow and solute transport
*	Introduction to the new Groundwater Energy (GWE) Model for MODFLOW 6
*	Introduction to the new Particle Tracking (PRT) Model for MODFLOW 6
*	Setting up and running parallel MODFLOW 6 simulations on laptops, desktops, and supercomputers
*	Using the MODFLOW Application Programming Interface (API) to couple with other models, create custom MODFLOW packages, and control MODFLOW during a simulation

## Intended Audience
This course is suited for groundwater modelers interested in learning about the USGS version of MODFLOW, its newer capabilities, and how to use FloPy to create and run simulations.  For attendees wanting to run live demonstrations, instructions for installing the required software on a laptop computer (Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems will be supported) will be provided in advance of the course.  No previous experience with FloPy or Python is required, however, participants without any Python experience may benefit from additional preparation prior to the class.
